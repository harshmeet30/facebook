I often ask people 'What do you think about outlier?' and 'What should you do with outlier?'. Many answered that outlier is distracting and need to be removed.
In truth, the outlier is as interesting as any other data. What you do with the outlier of course depends on what context your question is. Nevertheless, the outlier is as important as any other data. For that case, I try to create a post to tell outlier importance.

- Installing and using Apache Spark
- Creating your first Apache Spark machine learning model
For this example, I used a very basic dataset. The Titanic dataset, hopefully, you are all familiar with the case and the data. I predicted if a passenger survived or not depending on its features.

159,2611238135643533,"Hi all,
A lot of people use Keras to train their deep learning models.
When you train models you need to evaluate them as well but choosing a good metric can be tricky.
- you need to understand which metrics are already available in Keras and tf.keras and how to use them,
- in many situations, you need to define your own custom metric because the metric you are looking for doesn’t ship with Keras.
- sometimes you want to monitor model performance by looking at charts like ROC curve or Confusion Matrix after every epoch.
We've put together an article that explains all that and more.
I hope, this will be helpful to you!

I was reading a blog which states the following. Could someone plz interpret it for me what does it mean to find the bias of a model?
Suppose that you have a regression problem and you are interested in measuring RMSE. Imagine that, for your data, there is some “true” RMSE value that a particular model could achieve. The bias is the difference between what the resampling procedure estimates your RMSE to be for that model and the true RMSE. Basically, you can think of it as accuracy of estimation. The precision measures how variable the result is. Some types of resampling have higher bias than others and the same is true for precision.","Hello, I am interesting it to find the bias of a ML model (i.e. RF) when it perform prediction on some data..
